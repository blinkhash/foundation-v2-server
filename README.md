This portal is an extremely efficient, highly scalable, all-in-one, easy to setup cryptocurrency mining platform written entirely in Node.JS. Its main features include integrated stratum functionality and a reward/payment/share processor. The website functionality has been removed in lieu of a client that will be developed in a separate repository. For help with getting started, you can check out the documentation for the platform at https://blinkhash.com/docs.

#### Need Support?

If you need help with a code-related matter, the first place to look is our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rNjez6VgNF), where the developers will be available to answer any questions. However, please do not come to me with issues regarding setup. Use Google and the existing documentation for that.

### Donations

Maintaining this project has always been driven out of nothing more than a desire to give back to the mining community, however I always appreciate donations, especially if this repository helps you in any way.
